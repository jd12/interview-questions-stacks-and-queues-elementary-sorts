1. **Queue with two stacks.**

Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.

Hint: If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they appear in reverse order. If you repeat this process, they're now back in order.


2. **Stack with max.**

Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them.

Hint: Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximums.

3. **Java generics.** 

Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

Hint: to start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but Java generics are not: that is, `String[]` is a subtype of `Object[]`, but `Stack<String>` is not a subtype of `Stack<Object>`.

### Bonus

**4. Dutch national flag.**

Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

- `swap(i,j)`:  swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.

- `color(i)`: determine the color of the pebble in bucket i.

The performance requirements are as follows:

- At most n calls to color().

- At most n calls to swap().

Constant extra space.

Hint: 3-way partitioning.
